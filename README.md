# A-Power-BI-Dashboard-For-Weather-Report-And-Forecasting-Analysis-with-Python
This is an end-to-end Weather Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, designed to transform raw weather data into clear, decision-ready insights.
The workflow started with data cleaning and preprocessing in Python (Pandas, NumPy) to ensure data quality and consistency. The prepared dataset was then modelled in Power BI, where I created custom DAX measures to drive accurate calculations and meaningful analysis.

Key elements of the dashboard include:

Interactive year-level slicers for flexible time-series analysis

KPI cards powered by DAX calculations for metrics such as average temperature, wind speed, pressure, dew point, and heat index

Trend analysis comparing maximum vs. minimum temperature, humidity, and pressure across months

Seasonal views of rainfall and heat index to highlight patterns and extreme conditions

From a technical perspective, the focus was on:

Building an optimized data model with well-defined relationships

Writing efficient and reusable DAX measures for aggregations, comparisons, and trends

Designing visuals with a strong emphasis on clarity, performance, and stakeholder usability

This project reflects how combining Python for data preparation, DAX for analytical logic, and Power BI for visualization enables scalable, insight-driven analytics rather than static reporting.
